### Problem Statement

**Input:**  
1. Two arrays \( A \) and \( B \) of length \( n \), where each element \( A[i] \) and \( B[i] \) (for \( i = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \)) represents a single bit (0 or 1) of two \( n \)-bit binary integers. The most significant bit (MSB) is stored at \( A[0] \) and \( B[0] \), and the least significant bit (LSB) is stored at \( A[n-1] \) and \( B[n-1] \).

**Output:**  
1. An array \( C \) of length \( n+1 \), where each element \( C[i] \) (for \( i = 0, 1, \dots, n \)) represents a single bit of the sum of the binary integers stored in \( A \) and \( B \). The MSB of the sum is stored in \( C[0] \), and the LSB is stored in \( C[n] \).

**Goal:**  
Compute the binary sum of the integers represented by \( A \) and \( B \), including any carry from the addition, and store the result in \( C \).

### Pseudocode

```text
BinaryAddition(A, B, n):
    Input: Arrays A and B of size n, where each element is a binary digit (0 or 1)
    Output: Array C of size n+1, representing the sum of the binary integers A and B

    Initialize an array C of size n+1 with all elements set to 0
    carry ← 0  // Initialize the carry bit to 0

    for i ← n-1 down to 0 do:
        sum ← A[i] + B[i] + carry
        C[i+1] ← sum % 2  // Store the least significant bit of the sum in C[i+1]
        carry ← sum // 2  // Update the carry to be the most significant bit of the sum

    // After processing all bits, store the final carry in C[0]
    C[0] ← carry

    return C
```

---

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an empty array \( C \) of size \( n+1 \).
   - Initialize the carry to 0.

2. **Iterative Addition:**
   - Loop through the arrays \( A \) and \( B \) from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost).
   - For each position \( i \), compute the sum of \( A[i] \), \( B[i] \), and the current \( carry \).
   - Extract the resulting bit (either 0 or 1) to store in \( C[i+1] \) using \( \text{sum} \mod 2 \).
   - Compute the new carry as \( \text{sum} // 2 \).

3. **Final Carry:**
   - After the loop, store the final carry bit in \( C[0] \).

4. **Output:**
   - Return the result array \( C \), which contains the binary representation of the sum.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input:
- \( A = [1, 0, 1, 1] \) (binary for 11 in decimal)  
- \( B = [1, 1, 0, 1] \) (binary for 13 in decimal)  
- \( n = 4 \)

#### Execution:
1. Initialize \( C = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \), \( carry = 0 \).
2. Start from \( i = 3 \):
   - \( \text{sum} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \), \( C[4] = 2 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( carry = 2 // 2 = 1 \).
3. \( i = 2 \):
   - \( \text{sum} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \), \( C[3] = 2 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( carry = 2 // 2 = 1 \).
4. \( i = 1 \):
   - \( \text{sum} = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \), \( C[2] = 2 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( carry = 2 // 2 = 1 \).
5. \( i = 0 \):
   - \( \text{sum} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \), \( C[1] = 3 \mod 2 = 1 \), \( carry = 3 // 2 = 1 \).
6. Final carry:
   - \( C[0] = 1 \).

#### Output:
- \( C = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] \) (binary for 24 in decimal).
